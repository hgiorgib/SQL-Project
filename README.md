## Challenges 
*Lack of more detailed information about the columns in the Excel files that would help to better optimize and tweak them.

*The unavailability of mentors during the weekend limits the room to clarify doubts.

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)

*I would do a deeper DB QA process, verifying it data completeness, uniqueness, and consistency, and creating a new clean copy of the eCommerce DB.

*I would do a more exhaustive results verification to improve my queries.
